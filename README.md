# Kanji Learning App

This is my hobby project for learning kanji (Japanese characters). 

Project has been built with React, JavaScript, HTML and CSS and utilizing the external API kindly provided by [kanji alive](https://rapidapi.com/KanjiAlive/api/learn-to-read-and-write-japanese-kanji/).

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the directory with `cd kanjiapp`
3. Launch app with `npm start`
   - (If `npm start` does not work, ensure you have React installed on your computer.)
4. If not opened automatically, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your chosen browser to display the app.
