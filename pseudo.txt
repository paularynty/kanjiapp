///EXTRA

- use history api or save the results in a url
- especially ascending/descending sort in separate urls to ease going back/forward


backend:
- I fetch the api data in kanjiController, and use app.get in index.js
- for the user authentication, I use express router
- for password hashing and salting, I use bcrypt and jwt (json web token)
- for extra security, database queries are structured like: $1, variable;
